**üß† Model Summary**

This model is a **gradient boosting classifier** trained using the **XGBoost** algorithm. It uses patient health indicators to predict the probability of heart attack occurrence (binary classification: 0 = No risk, 1 = At risk).

### Architecture

* Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
    
* Objective: Binary Classification
    
* Features: 25+ health metrics including **Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate, Diabetes**, and **Lifestyle indicators** like **Smoking, Obesity**, etc.
    
* Labels: `Heart Attack Risk` (0 or 1)
    

### Characteristics

* Handles missing/non-critical fields like `Country`, `Continent`, `Income`, and `Patient ID` gracefully
    
* Well-suited for deployment in healthcare dashboards or apps
    
* Lightweight model with fast inference (&lt;50ms)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Code Snippet

```plaintext
pythonCopyEditimport joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the model
model = joblib.load("heart_model_final.pkl")

# Example input data
input_data = pd.DataFrame([{
    "Age": 52,
    "Sex": 1,
    "Cholesterol": 205,
    "Blood Pressure": 135,
    "Heart Rate": 85,
    "Diabetes": 1,
    "Family History": 1,
    "Smoking": 0,
    "Obesity": 1,
    "Alcohol Consumption": 0,
    "Exercise Hours Per Week": 1,
    "Diet": 1,
    "Previous Heart Problems": 0,
    "Medication Use": 1,
    "Stress Level": 3,
    "Sedentary Hours Per Day": 8,
    "BMI": 28.5,
    "Triglycerides": 180,
    "Physical Activity Days Per Week": 3,
    "Sleep Hours Per Day": 6
}])

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_data)[0]
print("Heart Attack Risk:", "Yes" if prediction == 1 else "No")
```

### Input Format

* Inputs: Pandas DataFrame with structured numeric data (no missing mandatory features)
    
* Outputs: Binary class label (0: No risk, 1: Risk)
    

### Known Issues

* Model assumes data is clean and properly formatted.
    
* False positives may occur in edge cases like high stress but no other symptoms.
