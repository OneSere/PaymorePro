## 💡 Introduction

Seamless, secure, and scalable payment systems are at the heart of modern digital businesses. Whether you’re running a subscription-based platform, selling digital products, or offering premium services, your users expect fast, reliable, and trustworthy payment experiences.

To solve this, we integrated the **Paymore Payment System** — a lightweight, developer-friendly platform that bridges the gap between affordability and automation.

## ⚙️ Why Paymore?

We chose Paymore for a few key reasons:

* **Flexible integration** via RESTful APIs
    
* **Low transaction fees**, ideal for student- or creator-focused platforms
    
* **Fast UPI support** with real-time notifications
    
* **Smart callbacks** for automation, inventory, and subscription systems
    
* **Security-first approach**, including OTP validation and fraud detection
    

This made Paymore the perfect choice for platforms focused on **micro-transactions**, **limited-use keys**, or **premium digital content** like ours.

## 🔧 Integration Overview

We implemented Paymore in our service to handle:

* One-time payments for subscriptions and services
    
* Key-based access control (after successful payment)
    
* Auto-verification using **webhooks** or **forwarded SMS to Gmail**
    
* Dynamic payment linking via APIs or QR generation
    

### Core Workflow:

1. **User lands on checkout** page → Clicks "Pay Now"
    
2. **Paymore UPI QR** is shown or redirected via link
    
3. On payment:
    
    * A **Google Sheet** (or Firebase) logs the payment
        
    * The system verifies payment using SMS/webhook/Paymore API
        
    * If verified, access is granted or account is activated
