## 🚀 What is YOLO Security System Pro?

Developed as part of a hands-on computer vision learning project, this system uses state-of-the-art AI to detect people, trigger alerts, and log critical moments—all with minimal human intervention.

Despite being a solo-developed tool by a bachelor's student, the system integrates technologies you'd expect from enterprise-level surveillance:

* 🔍 Object & Motion Detection
    
* 📷 Auto-Capture on Detection
    
* 📐 Customizable Detection Zones
    
* 📲 SMS Alerts via Twilio
    
* 🔊 Siren Triggering System
    
* 🛠 Adjustable Confidence & Sensitivity Thresholds
    
* 🖥️ Modern GUI (CustomTkinter)

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🎯 YOLOv8 Object Detection

Ultra-fast and highly accurate detection of people and objects using the YOLOv8 deep learning model.

### 🕵️ Motion Detection

Detects real movement and filters out background noise, helping reduce false alarms.

### 📲 SMS Alert System

Integrates with Twilio to send real-time alerts directly to your mobile phone when a person is detected in a critical zone.

### 📷 Automatic Image Capture

Captures and saves snapshots of the frame when key events occur.

### 📐 Detection Zone Customization

Define your own focus areas within the webcam feed for precise monitoring and minimized distractions.

### 🔊 Siren Support

Trigger alarms in response to detections—ideal for scaring off intruders or drawing attention.

### ⚙️ Full Parameter Control

Modify detection confidence, capture intervals, motion thresholds, and more—all via a GUI.
